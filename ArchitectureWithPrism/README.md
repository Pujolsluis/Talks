# Let's Talk Architecture with Prism - Xamarin Forms
On Saturday 2nd of March 2019, I had the opportunity of participating in the 15th edition of South Florida Code Camp, that is a one-day GEEK FEST community event driven by a group of dedicated volunteers and speakers. I got the chance to talk about Architecture with Prism in Xamarin Forms.

My participation was on the Xamarin/Mobile Development Track, I got to meet the Florida Community and we learned about Prism and all it provides like an implementation of a collection of design patterns that are helpful in writing well-structured and maintainable Xamarin applications, including MVVM, dependency injection, Commands, EventAggregator, and others.
