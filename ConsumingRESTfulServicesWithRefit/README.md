# Consuming RESTful Services with Refit - Xamarin Forms
On Saturday 30th of March 2019, I had the opportunity of participating in the 14th edition of South Florida Code Camp, that is Orlando Codecamp is a free, one day learning event for programming professionals and students with a focus on coding, databases and related technologies, concepts and practices. This is a "grass roots" mini application platform developer conferences, free of charge to attendees and open to presenters of all stripes and experience. I got the chance to talk about Consuming RESTful Services with Refit in Xamarin Forms.

My participation was on the Mobile Development Track, I got to meet the Orlando Community and we learned about Refit and all the goodies it provides us to turn our API's into a live interface in our Xamarin Mobile App's we can interact with.
